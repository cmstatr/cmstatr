\title{Glance at a \code{equiv_change_mean} object}
\usage{
\method{glance}{equiv_change_mean}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{equiv_change_mean} object returned from
\code{\link{equiv_change_mean}}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments. Not used. Included only to match generic
signature.}
}
\value{
A one-row \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble}} with the following
columns:

\item{\code{alpha}}{the value of alpha passed to this function}
\item{\code{n_sample}}{the number of observations in the sample for which
  equivalency is being checked. This is either the value \code{n_sample}
  passed to this function or the length of the vector \code{data_sample}.}
\item{\code{mean_sample}}{the mean of the observations in the sample for
  which equivalency is being checked. This is either the value
  \code{mean_sample} passed to this function or the mean of the vector
  \code{data-sample}.}
\item{\code{sd_sample}}{the standard deviation of the observations in the
  sample for which equivalency is being checked. This is either the value
  \code{mean_sample} passed to this function or the standard deviation of
  the vector \code{data-sample}.}
\item{\code{n_qual}}{the number of observations in the qualification data
  to which the sample is being compared for equivalency. This is either
  the value \code{n_qual} passed to this function or the length of the
  vector \code{data_qual}.}
\item{\code{mean_qual}}{the mean of the qualification data to which the
  sample is being compared for equivalency. This is either the value
  \code{mean_qual} passed to this function or the mean of the vector
  \code{data_qual}.}
\item{\code{sd_qual}}{the standard deviation of the qualification data to
  which the sample is being compared for equivalency. This is either the
  value \code{mean_qual} passed to this function or the standard deviation
  of the vector \code{data_qual}.}
\item{\code{modcv}}{logical value indicating whether the equivalency
  calculations were performed using the modified CV approach}
\item{\code{sp}}{the value of the pooled standard deviation. If
  \code{modecv = TRUE}, this pooled standard deviation includes the
  modification to the qualification CV.}
\item{\code{t0}}{the test statistic}
\item{\code{t_req}}{the t-value for \eqn{\alpha / 2} and
  \eqn{df = n1 + n2 -2}}
\item{\code{threshold_min}}{the minimum value of the sample mean that would
  result in a pass}
\item{\code{threshold_max}}{the maximum value of the sample mean that would
  result in a pass}
\item{\code{result}}{a character vector of either "PASS" or "FAIL"
  indicating the result of the test for change in mean}
}
\description{
Glance accepts an object of type \code{equiv_change_mean}
 and returns a \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble}} with
one row of summaries.

Glance does not do any calculations: it just gathers the results in a
tibble.
