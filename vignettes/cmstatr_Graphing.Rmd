This vignette demonstrates how to create some of the graphs commonly used
when analyzing composite material data. Here, we rely on the
[`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package for graphing. This package
can be loaded either on its own, or through the `tidyverse` meta-package, which
also includes packages such as `dplyr` that we will also use.

We'll need to load a few packages in order to proceed.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(cmstatr)
```

Throughout this vignette, we'll use one of the example data sets that
comes with `cmstatr` and we'll focus on the warp-tension data as an
example. We'll load the example data in a variable as follows. By default
the condition will be in an arbitrary order, but throughout the visualization,
we'll want the conditions shown in a particular order (from coldest and driest
to hottest and wettest). We can define the order of the conditions using
the `ordered` function. For brevity, only the first few rows of the data set
are displayed below.

```{r}
dat <- carbon.fabric.2 %>%
  filter(test == "WT") %>%
  mutate(condition = ordered(condition, c("CTD", "RTD", "ETW", "ETW2")))

dat %>%
  head(10)
```

We'll then calculate the B-Basis value using the pooling by standard deviation
method. This data set happens to fail some of the diagnostic tests, but for the
purpose of this example, we'll ignore those failures using the
`override` argument.

```{r}
b_basis_pooled <- dat %>%
  basis_pooled_cv(strength, condition, batch,
                  override = c("between_group_variability",
                               "normalized_variance_equal"))

b_basis_pooled
```

The object returned from `basis_pooled_cv` contains a number of values.
One value is a `data.frame` containing the groups (i.e. conditions)
and the corresponding basis values. This looks like the following. We'll
use this in the visualizations.

```{r}
b_basis_pooled$basis
```


# Batch Plots
Batch plots are used to identify differences between batches.
Simple batch plots can be created using box plots and adding
horizontal lines for the basis values as follows. Note that
the heavy line in the box of the box plot is the *median*, not
the mean. The two hinges correspond with the first and third
quantiles and the whiskers extend to the most extreme data point,
or 1.5 times the inner quantile range.

In the code below, we use the function `rename` to rename the
column `group` to `condition`. The `data.frame` produced by
`basis_pooled_cv` uses the columns `value` and `group`, but
to match the data, we need the column with the conditions
to be named `condition`.

```{r}
dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = batch, y = strength)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.25) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = value),
             data = b_basis_pooled$basis %>% rename(condition = group),
             color = "blue") +
  facet_grid(. ~ condition) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Batch Plot")
```

# Quantile Plots
A quantile plot provides a graphical summary of sample values. 
This plot displays the sample values and the corresponding quantile.
A quantile  plot can  be used to examine the symmetry and tail sizes of the
underlying distribution. Sharp rises may indicate the presence of outliers. 

```{r}
dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = strength, color = condition)) +
  stat_ecdf(geom = "point") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Quantile Plot")
```

# Normal Survival Function Plots
An empirical survival function, and the corresponding normal survival
function can be plotted using two `ggplot` "stat" functions provided
by `cmstatr`. In the example below, the empirical survival function
is plotted for each condition, and the survival function for a normal
distribution with the mean and variance from the data is also plotted
(the survival function is 1 minus the cumulative distribution function).
This type of plot can be used to identify how closely the data follows
a normal distribution, and also to compare the distributions of the
various conditions.

```{r}
dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = strength, color = condition)) +
  stat_normal_surv_func() +
  stat_esf() +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Normal Survival Function Plot")
```


# Normal Score Plots
The normal scores plot calculates the normal score and plots it against
the normal score. Normal plots are useful to investigate distributions of
the data.

```{r}
dat %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  mutate(norm.score = scale(strength)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = norm.score, y = strength, colour = condition)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Normal Scores Plot") +
  theme_bw()
```

# Q-Q Plots

A Q-Q plot compares the data against the
theoretical quantiles for a particular distribution.
A line is also plotted showing
the normal distribution with mean and variance from the data. If the data
exactly followed a normal distribution, all points would fall on this line.

```{r}
dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = strength, colour = condition)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  ggtitle("Q-Q Plot") +
  theme_bw()
```


# Property Plots

Property plots allow for a variety of properties for a group to be 
compared to other properties within the same group, as well as to 
other group properties. The properties included in this plot are A-Basis, 
B-Basis, Pooled A- and B-Basis, Pooled Modified CV (Coefficient of Variation)
A- and B-Basis, Mean, and Min for each group.

The property plots will take a bit of work to construct.

First, the distribution of each group must be determined. Once the
distribution has been determined, the proper basis calculation based 
on that distribution should be filled in below. We also have a
column in the tables below for extra arguments to pass to the `basis`
function, such as overrides required or the method for the `basis_hk_ext`
function to use.

```{r}
b_basis_fcn <- tribble(
  ~condition, ~fcn, ~args,
  "CTD", "basis_normal", list(override = c("between_batch_variability")),
  "RTD", "basis_normal", list(override = c("between_batch_variability")),
  "ETW", "basis_hk_ext", NULL,
  "ETW2", "basis_normal", list(override = c("between_batch_variability"))
)

a_basis_fcn <- tribble(
  ~condition, ~fcn, ~args,
  "CTD", "basis_normal", list(override = c("between_batch_variability")),
  "RTD", "basis_normal", list(override = c("between_batch_variability")),
  "ETW", "basis_hk_ext", list(method = "woodward-frawley"),
  "ETW2", "basis_normal", list(override = c("between_batch_variability"))
)
```

We'll write a function that takes the data and information about
the distribution and computes the single-point
basis value. We'll use this
function for both A- and B-Basis, so we'll add a parameter for the
probability (0.90 or 0.99).

```{r}
single_point_fcn <- function(group_x, group_batch, cond, basis_fcn, p) {
  fcn <- basis_fcn$fcn[basis_fcn$condition == cond[1]]
  extra_args <- basis_fcn$args[basis_fcn$condition == cond[1]]

  args <- c(
    list(x = group_x, batch = group_batch, p = p),
    unlist(extra_args))
  basis <- do.call(fcn, args)
  basis$basis
}

single_point_results <- dat %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarise(single_point_b_basis = single_point_fcn(
              strength, batch, condition, b_basis_fcn, 0.90),
            single_point_a_basis = single_point_fcn(
              strength, batch, condition, a_basis_fcn, 0.99),
            minimum = min(strength),
            mean = mean(strength)) %>%
  mutate(condition = ordered(condition, c("CTD", "RTD", "ETW", "ETW2")))

single_point_results
```

In the above code, we also ensure that the condition column is still
in the order we expect.

We've already computed the B-Basis of the data using a pooling method.
We'll do the same for A-Basis:

```{r}
a_basis_pooled <- dat %>%
  basis_pooled_cv(strength, condition, batch, p = 0.99,
                  override = c("between_group_variability",
                               "normalized_variance_equal"))

a_basis_pooled
```

As we saw before, the returned object has a property called `basis`,
which is a `data.frame` for the pooling methods.

```{r}
a_basis_pooled$basis
```

We can take this `data.frame` and change the column names
to suit our needs.

```{r}
a_basis_pooled$basis %>%
  rename(condition = group,
         b_basis_pooled = value)
```

We can combine all these steps into one statement. We'll also ensure
that the conditions are listed in the order we want.

```{r}
a_basis_pooled_results <- a_basis_pooled$basis %>%
  rename(condition = group,
         a_basis_pooled = value) %>%
  mutate(condition = ordered(condition, c("CTD", "RTD", "ETW", "ETW2")))

a_basis_pooled_results
```

And the same thing for B-Basis:

```{r}
b_basis_pooled_results <- b_basis_pooled$basis %>%
  rename(condition = group,
         b_basis_pooled = value) %>%
  mutate(condition = ordered(condition, c("CTD", "RTD", "ETW", "ETW2")))

b_basis_pooled_results
```

We can use the function `inner_join` from the `dplyr` package to combine
the three sets of computational results. Each row for each condition
will be concatenated.

```{r}
single_point_results %>%
  inner_join(b_basis_pooled_results, by = "condition") %>%
  inner_join(a_basis_pooled_results, by = "condition")
```

To use this table in the plot we're trying to construct, we want to
"lengthen" the table as follows.

```{r}
single_point_results %>%
  inner_join(b_basis_pooled_results, by = "condition") %>%
  inner_join(a_basis_pooled_results, by = "condition") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = single_point_b_basis:a_basis_pooled)
```


We can now make a plot based on this:

```{r}
single_point_results %>%
  inner_join(b_basis_pooled_results, by = "condition") %>%
  inner_join(a_basis_pooled_results, by = "condition") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = single_point_b_basis:a_basis_pooled) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = strength), data = dat) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = name, color = name)) +
  ggtitle("Property Graph") +
  theme_bw()
```


# Nested Data Plots

`cmstatr` contains the function `nested_data_plot`. This function creates a
plot showing the sources of variation. In the following example, the data
is grouped according to the variables in the `group` argument. The data
is first grouped according to `batch`, then according to `panel`. The
labels located according to the data points that fall under them.
By default, the mean is used, but that `stat` argument can be used to
locate the labels according to `median` or some other statistic.


```{r}
carbon.fabric.2 %>%
  mutate(panel = as.character(panel)) %>%
  filter(test == "WT") %>%
  nested_data_plot(strength,
                   groups = c(batch, panel))
```

Optionally, `fill` or `color` can be set as follows:

```{r}
carbon.fabric.2 %>%
  mutate(panel = as.character(panel)) %>%
  filter(test == "WT" & condition == "RTD") %>%
  nested_data_plot(strength,
                   groups = c(batch, panel),
                   fill = batch,
                   color = panel)
```
